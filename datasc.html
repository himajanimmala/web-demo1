	<p>Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and
 insights from structured and unstructured data.[1][2] Data science is the same concept as data mining and big data: "use the most
 powerful hardware, the most powerful programming systems, and the most efficient algorithms to solve problems".[3]</p>

<p>Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and
 analyze actual phenomena" with data.[4] It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics,
 statistics, computer science, and information science. Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of
 science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of
 the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.[5][6] In 2015, the American Statistical Association identified database
 management, statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional 
communities.[7]</p>

<p>In 2012, when Harvard Business Review called it "The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century",[8] the term "data science" became a buzzword. 
It is now often used interchangeably with earlier concepts like business analytics,[9] business intelligence, predictive modeling, and
 statistics. Even the suggestion that data science is sexy was paraphrasing Hans Rosling, featured in a 2011 BBC documentary with the
 quote, "Statistics is now the sexiest subject around."[10] Nate Silver referred to data science as a sexed up term for statistics.[11]
 In many cases, earlier approaches and solutions are now simply rebranded as "data science" to be more attractive, which can cause the
 term to become "dilute[d] beyond usefulness."[12] While many university programs now offer a data science degree, there exists no
 consensus on a definition or suitable curriculum contents.[9] To its discredit, however, many data-science and big-data projects fail 
to deliver useful results, often as a result of poor management and utilization of resources.The term "data science" has appeared in
 various contexts over the past thirty years but did not become an established term until recently. In an early usage, it was used as a
 substitute for computer science by Peter Naur in 1960. Naur later introduced the term "datalogy".[17] In 1974, Naur published Concise
 Survey of Computer Methods, which freely used the term data science in its survey of the contemporary data processing methods that are
 used in a wide range of applications.</p>

<p>The modern definition of "data science" was first sketched during the second Japanese-French statistics symposium organized at the
 University of Montpellier II (France) in 1992[18]. The attendees acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline with a specific focus 
on data from various origins, dimensions, types and structures. They shaped the contour of this new science based on established concepts
 and principles of statistics and data analysis with the extensive use of the increasing power of computer tools.

In 1996, members of the International Federation of Classification Societies (IFCS) met in Kobe for their biennial conference. Here, for 
the first time, the term data science is included in the title of the conference ("Data Science, classification, and related methods")
,[19] after the term was introduced in a roundtable discussion by Chikio Hayashi.[4]

In November 1997, C.F. Jeff Wu gave the inaugural lecture entitled "Statistics = Data Science?"[20] for his appointment to the H. C.
 Carver Professorship at the University of Michigan.[21] In this lecture, he characterized statistical work as a trilogy of data
 collection, data modeling and analysis, and decision making. In his conclusion, he initiated the modern, non-computer science, usage of
 the term "data science" and advocated that statistics be renamed data science and statisticians data scientists.[20] Later, he presented
 his lecture entitled "Statistics = Data Science?" as the first of his 1998 P.C. Mahalanobis Memorial Lectures.[22] These lectures honor
 Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis, an Indian scientist and statistician and founder of the Indian Statistical Institute.</p>

<p>In 2001, William S. Cleveland introduced data science as an independent discipline, extending the field of statistics to incorporate
 "advances in computing with data" in his article "Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of 
Statistics," which was published in Volume 69, No. 1, of the April 2001 edition of the International Statistical Review / Revue
 Internationale de Statistique.[23] In his report, Cleveland establishes six technical areas which he believed to encompass the field of
 data science: multidisciplinary investigations, models and methods for data, computing with data, pedagogy, tool evaluation, and theory.

In April 2002, the International Council for Science (ICSU): Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA)[24] started the Data
 Science Journal,[25] a publication focused on issues such as the description of data systems, their publication on the internet, 
applications and legal issues.[26] Shortly thereafter, in January 2003, Columbia University began publishing The Journal of Data
 Science,[27] which provided a platform for all data workers to present their views and exchange ideas. The journal was largely devoted 
to the application of statistical methods and quantitative research. In 2005, The National Science Board published "Long-lived Digital
 Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century" defining data scientists as "the information and computer
 scientists, database and software and programmers, disciplinary experts, curators and expert annotators, librarians, archivists, and 
others, who are crucial to the successful management of a digital data collection" whose primary activity is to "conduct creative inquiry
 and analysis."[28]</p>

<p>Around 2007,[citation needed] Turing award winner Jim Gray envisioned "data-driven science" as a "fourth paradigm" of science that uses 
the computational analysis of large data as primary scientific method[5][6] and "to have a world in which all of the science literature 
is online, all of the science data is online, and they interoperate with each other."[29]

In the 2012 Harvard Business Review article "Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century",[8] DJ Patil claims to have coined
 this term in 2008 with Jeff Hammerbacher to define their jobs at LinkedIn and Facebook, respectively. He asserts that a data scientist
 is "a new breed", and that a "shortage of data scientists is becoming a serious constraint in some sectors", but describes a much more
 business-oriented role.

In 2013, the IEEE Task Force on Data Science and Advanced Analytics[30] was launched. In 2013, the first "European Conference on Data
 Analysis (ECDA)" was organised in Luxembourg, establishing the European Association for Data Science (EuADS). The first international
 conference: IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics was launched in 2014.[31] In 2014, General Assembly
 launched student-paid bootcamp and The Data Incubator launched a competitive free data science fellowship.</p>
